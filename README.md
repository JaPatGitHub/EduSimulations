# GamifyingEdu

### 😀 Hey there! Nice to see you!!👋👋🏿👋🏽👋🏻👋🏾👋🏼

Ever felt horrible studying in school because the world has stuff a hundred time more **interesting** to do, like playing video-games?(I bet you have) And ever realized partly a reason for this is you don't know **why** on earth you're learning the stuff that you're learning? These are two of the **fundamental flaws of education** the way it is today. Not satisfied? _[Let Elon Musk tell you][elon-musk-video]_.

GamifyingEdu exactly aims to solve these problems by creating games that make learning:

1. **fun**; because they are games! And,
2. **meaningful**; by demostrating real world applications of concepts or their abstract beauty.

And very importantly, these games are made such that they can be **easily integrated** in the classrooms with existing curriculums.

Social good through accessibility to high quality educational resources if one of GamifyingEdu's top priorities, and hence it is free and open-sourced.

## Technologies Used, and Subjects Covered

GamifyingEdu uses **[p5.js][p5js-website]**, a wonderdul javascript library that enables create interactive visualizations with code for its **Physics** games. [Daniel Shiffman's][shiffman-website] **Nature of Code** ([book][noc-book-preface], [video series][noc-videos]) lays the foundation of the concept of Natural Simulations used to create them.

There are plans to further extend into subjects like mathematics, economics and geography; additionally using libraries like d3.js, NASA Worldwind, leaflet.js etc.
