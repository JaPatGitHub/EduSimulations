# GamifyingEdu

### 😀 Hey there! Nice to see you!!👋👋🏿👋🏽👋🏻👋🏾👋🏼

Felt horrible studying during your schooling? I bet you have. Why?

1. It's boring.
2. "What on earth am I gonna do with this?" feeling.

This is what I believe is fundamentally flawed with education the way it is today. (Maybe Un)Surprisingly, [Elon Musk too feels the same.][elon-musk-video]

GamifyingEdu solves these problems by creating games that make learning:
1. fun, because they are games! And,
2. meaningful, by demostrating real world applications of concepts.

On the top of it, these games are accesible to all and easily integrable into existing curriculums

## Demo

Check out this [tank shooter][tank-shooter-game] game based on projectile motion!

## Technologies Used, and Subjects Covered

GamifyingEdu uses **[p5.js][p5js-website]**, a wonderdul javascript library that enables create interactive visualizations with code for its **Physics** games. [Daniel Shiffman's][shiffman-website] **Nature of Code** ([book][noc-book-preface], [video series][noc-videos]) lays the foundation of the concept of Natural Simulations used to create them.

There are plans to further extend into subjects like mathematics, economics and geography; additionally using libraries like d3.js, NASA Worldwind, leaflet.js etc.
