# SimulatingEdu: Making Interactive Animations in Education the Norm
### Nice to see you!!!ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹

> Before moving forward : I'm a lone 15 yo guy working on this project which I hope to see become huge resource built by a wonderful community someday. I'm looking for a co-founder and other people who'd like to work on this project. Beginner myself, and no matter who you are, if you're even a bit interested to work on this project, feel free to [email](mailto:japsim6dev@gmail.com) or [DM](https://twitter.com/jyotir1221) me or create a new issue.

Were(or are) you tired of dry learning from lectures and textbooks in your schooldays? Imagine a day when every single concept taught can be something visulized and played with?

Making this real and available to all is SimulatingEdu's mission.
